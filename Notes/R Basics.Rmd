c() is a function. It’s short for “combine” or “concatenate”. It will take a sequence of comma-separated things inside the parentheses and join them together into a vector where each element is still individually accessible.

The assignment operator is <-. Think of assignment as the verb “gets”, reading left to right. Shortcut: Alt+minus

ls() displays the names of objects in your workspace


```{r}
my_numbers<-c(1,2,3,1,3,5,25)
my_numbers
mean(my_numbers)
median(my_numbers)
summary(my_numbers)
#standard deviation
sd(my_numbers)
#simple operations
my_numTimes5 <- my_numbers*5
rm(my_numTimes5)
my_numbers+1
my_numPower3 <- my_numbers*my_numbers*my_numbers
my_numPower3
rm(list = ls())
```
Reading csv
